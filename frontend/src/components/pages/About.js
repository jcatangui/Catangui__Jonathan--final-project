        <p>
          Ever since I can remember I've been passionate about technology. I
          started my career in the hardware electronics space. Slowly as life
          progressed, so did my work needs. I've slowly been getting involved in
          the software side of things. Today I'm adding another skill set in the
          form of Full Stack Web Development.
